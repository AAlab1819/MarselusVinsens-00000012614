# THE RUNNING MEDIAN

  1. Inputs ( Number )
  2. From the numbers there is lines
  3. Sort Numbers
  4. Median will be acquired by dividing input number by 2
  
  
  complexity: O (n log n)
  
 # ROY AND THE TRENDING TOPICS
 
  -	When a topic is mentioned in a 'Post', its z-score increased by 50.
  -	A 'Like' on a Post, it increases the z-score by 5.
  -	A 'Comment' increases z-score by 10.
  -	A 'Share' will causes an increment of 20.
  
   The Output is to print 5 topics each in a new line
   each line should contain two space separated integers (the Topics and the new z-score of topic).
   
   
   complexity: O (n log n)
